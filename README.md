# Alter
Alter, a Tetris-like game, is named for its core gameplay mechanic of transformation. The game is currently under development.<br/>
**Alter，类俄罗斯方块游戏，名称来自于核心玩法，也即变换。正在研发中。**

The rotation method refers to the SRS (The Super Rotation System), but without wall kicks. <br/>
**旋转方式参考了 SRS（The Super Rotation System），但没有踢墙。**

The landing rule adopts the logic used in "Tetris: The Grand Master", where the piece does not lock immediately after landing.<br/>
**落地规则采用了 TGM 中使用的，落地后不立刻锁定。**

Building on this, we added rules where different colored blocks overlap to form new colors and only blocks of the same color can be cleared. However, this seems to have made the game less enjoyable than the original version.<br/>
**在此基础上，增加了不同颜色的方块会重叠成新的颜色、只有相同颜色方块才能消除的规则，但似乎让游戏变得不如原版好玩了。**

No leveling rules and scoring rules have been implemented yet.<br/>
**暂未做升关规则和计分规则。**
